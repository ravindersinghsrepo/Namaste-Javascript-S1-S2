Episode 1 callback
Callbacks are a powerful way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are called later when the asynchronous operation is completed.

The good parts of callbacks are:

They are a powerful way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript.
They allow you to take a piece of code and pass it as a callback, which can be executed later.
The bad parts of callbacks are:

Callback hell: This occurs when you have nested callbacks inside of each other, making the code difficult to read and maintain.
Inversion of control: When you pass a callback function to another function, you give up control of your code to that other function. This can make it difficult to reason about how your code will behave.
Here are the key points:

Callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
Callbacks can lead to callback hell, which makes code difficult to read and maintain.
Callbacks can also lead to inversion of control, which means you give up control of your code to other functions.
